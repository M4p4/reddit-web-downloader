## Reddit web downloader

This Reddit web downloader written in Next.js is a tool that allows users to easily download images, videos, and GIFs from a specified subreddit or user by utilizing the Pushshift API.

#### How to use it?

You can run the program on your local machine, but it may not be able to download certain external resources because those websites block download requests coming from localhost. The best option is to open the URL on GitHub or to modify the code and host it on your own web server.

#### How does it work?

This program will collect submissions from a specific user or subreddit and download any images, videos, or gifs that it finds. It will do this directly within your web browser. Once the program is finished, you will be given a zip file that you can download and extract to access the media files.
